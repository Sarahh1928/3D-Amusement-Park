# 3D Amusement Park Modeling and Game

Welcome to the exciting world of 3D modeling and game development! This project guides you through the creation of a captivating 3D model of an amusement park, complete with engaging animations and controls.

## Theme

Visualize a vibrant scene featuring the essentials of an amusement park: the ground, boundary walls, and an array of classic park objects like swings, chair swings, ferris wheels, and benches.

## Modeling

Bring the park to life with meticulous modeling:
- **Player:**
  - A human model to represent the player.

- **Goal:**
  - A delightful smiley face symbolizes our goal.

## Collisions

Ensure a dynamic experience:
- The player freely roams within the scene but remains confined within the fence and ground borders.
- Watch as the player collides with the goal(s), causing them to disappear upon collection.

## Camera

Control your viewpoint:
- Effortlessly navigate through the park using arrow keys (up, left, down, right).
- Switch between Top View (key t), Side View (key c), and Front View (key f) for a comprehensive exploration.

## Animations and Controls

Add life to the park with animations and controls:
- **Player Movement:**
  - Navigate with ease: J (Right), K (Down), I (Up), L (Right).
  - Watch as the player gracefully rotates towards the direction of motion with the help of the mouse or keyboard.

- **Object Animations:**
  - Trigger captivating animations for each of the five scene objects using the M key.
  - Halt the animations using the same M key, allowing for dynamic control.

- **Goal Object Animation:**
  - The goal object(s) play a delightful animation, adding a touch of whimsy to the scene.

- **Color Changes:**
  - Observe the dynamic atmosphere as the colors of the boundary walls shift at regular intervals.

## Game End

Experience the grand finale:
- The game concludes as time runs out.
- Achieve victory by collecting the goal(s) within the specified time, unveiling a triumphant 'GAME WIN' screen.
- Should the goal remain uncollected, witness a humbling 'GAME LOSE' screen.

## Sound Features
- Immerse players in a sonic wonderland with background music and unique sound effects for animations and collisions, ensuring a truly immersive experience.

There you have it! Dive into the project, let your creativity flow, and watch as your amusement park comes to life. Happy coding!
